        Being from Michigan, I started skiing at the age of 6. It became a
        yearly activity that our parents practically forced us into. I began
        taking skii lessons with one of my childhood best friends named Allie,
        and before we knew it we were out on double black diamonds alone at the
        age of 10. As our yearly ski trips continued, Allie and I started to get
        slightly bored of skiing. That's when we decided to pick up
        snowboarding. We both took one lesson each and then from there we taught
        each other ways to improve. Now after snowboarding and skiing for almost
        14 years, I still look forward to going up north year after year. This
        year my family has a trip planned that we've been talking about for
        probably the last 5 years. We will be headed out west to Colorado over
        Christmas break. We are all so excited for this adventure and to
        experience the fresh powder the slopes in Colorado have compared to the
        icy runs we have back home in the mitten.
