      <h2><strong>Running</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Growing up, I never wanted to be a runner like my sister or my dad or my
        mom. I didn't see the point of it and thought that I would never truly
        enjoy it, especially after running multiple holiday 5ks with my family.
        But once I stopped competitively dancing after my freshman year, I knew
        I had to pick up another type of sport that would keep me active and
        give me a loyal community, and thats how I ended up running cross
        country and track in high school. Below, there is a list of all of the
        running events I competed in during my cross country and track seasons
        throughout high school.
